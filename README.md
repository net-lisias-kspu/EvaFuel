# EvaFuel /L Unleashed

EvaFuel is a simple mod that makes your spacewalks use monopropellant. It's really just designed for when you are playing on "hard mode", or just want to be realistic about spacewalks.

## Description

This is an update of Vendan's mod of the same name.

Like the original, Kerbals will now use Monopropellant for EVA fuel, instead of getting unlimited free fuel. The Kerbals take 5 units with them when they leave the ship, and return any leftover fuel back to the ship when they re-enter.

### New to this updated version:

Rescue contract ships will give Kerbals 1 unit of fuel to reach safety, instead of leaving them totally stranded.
Kerbal Inventory System's EVA tanks will also use Monopropellant to refill. (Props to IgorZ for the help.)
The fuel type and fuel conversion ratio is configurable. (Much thanks to Shinsaka.)

Changes from previous:

* Added log.cs (easier internal logging)
* Saves data to a file
* Adds mission limited fuel
